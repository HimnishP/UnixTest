bruh wtf Unix is important because it laid the foundation for modern operating systems.
Its design principles, such as simplicity, modularity, and portability, influenced
the development of Linux, macOS, and even Windows. Unix promotes the philosophy of
"do one thing and do it well," which led to the creation of efficient, reusable software tools. 
It introduced the idea of files as byte streams, which became a standard in computing. Unix's shell 
scripting capabilities enabled automation and system management. Its permission and user management 
systems provided robust security models. The open-source movement grew from Unix, democratizing 
software development. Unix also supported early internet protocols, making it integral to the
growth of networking. The influence of Unix can still be seen in cloud computing, mobile devices,
and supercomputers today.
